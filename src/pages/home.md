I am an academic and designer with a background in Industrial Design and Human-Computer Interaction. Recently, I completed a PhD on game design-based learning and serious games, supported by a Fulbright scholarship. Currently I teach Industrial Design and Design Communication and experiment with generative AI to support divergent thinking.
