I am a design lecturer and researcher with a PhD in game design-based learning and transformational play. My research was supported by a Fulbright scholarship, allowing me to be a visiting researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Currently, I teach industrial design studio, two design communication courses, and an introduction to game design course at TOBB ETÃœ in Ankara.
